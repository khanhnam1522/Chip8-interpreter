# TEAM 13 Product Document

## Meeting Schedule
- Our group has decided on two different time slots depending on the workload of the project
- Monday and Wednesday for approximately 30-60 mins after the 276 lecture

## Communication
- The main tool that our group will be using alongside our weekly meetings is Discord
- Discord allows us to share files and communicate ideas through text and voice chat

## Software
- We will be using a private GitHub repository as our version control

## Team Roles
- The structure of team roles will follow mostly a interchangeable format where some roles will be loosely dictated
- As the project develops the members of the group will slowly find themselves in roles that they can excel in
- The table below shows the current tasks that each member will begin working on; however, it is highly subject to change

| **Name** | **Roles** |
| :-- | :-- |
| Matthew Zegar | Chip8 emulator |
| Larren Canapi | Chip8 games |
| TJ Le | Chip8 visualizer |
| Raad Sarr | Chip8 visualizer |
| Khanh Nam Tang | Chip8 tool |

## Testing (TBD)
- Using existing Chip8 programs we can test our emulator in a variety of different cases
- Alongside the development of our Chip8 emulator a testing suite will be also created

# Tools
- Javascript will be the primary language used
- VScode is the IDE of choice
- Libraries will be determined as project develops

# Planned Use Cases (TBD)
- detailed use cases for all major features planned for the next release

# Work Breakdown
- Chip8 Emulator
  - Creating the Emulator tool first will be our highest priority, estimating it will be done by Release 1 (3 weeks)
- Chip8 Visualizer
  - After creating the emulator, we plan on creating the visualizer which we estimate will be done by Release 2 (3 weeks)
- Chip8 Tool
  - We decided to start work on the Chip8 tool after Release 2 and have it completed Release 3 or Release 4. (2 - 4 weeks)
  - We plan on having the tool be useful in our creation for the Chip8 games that we create like a Graphics Editor, but the idea of the tool will be finalized as the project develops.
- Chip8 Games 
  - We plan to start working on the games after Release 2, and have at least 1 game ready for Release 3. The other one will be done before Release 4.
  - We initially plan to code simple games like Pong and Breakout which we estimate will take about 1 week for each game
  - Complex or original games will be created if time permits, we estimate that would take 2 weeks
